# ADEX
The *Autonomous Driving Examiner* (ADEX) project is a joint research project between AVL, AIT and TU Vienna.
ADEX aims at developing a trustworthy examiner for controllers of self-driving vehicles. The project will adopt a scenario-based approach, combining techniques from artificial intelligence and traffic accident analysis to generate concrete challenging scenarios. Following a human-centred iterative design approach the developed automated verification and testing methodology will be transparent and provide user understandable. The project results will be evaluated both in virtual (simulation) and physical environments. Project outcomes will help to significantly increase the trust of design engineers and regulatory bodies in autonomous-driving controllers.
